# Latex tips and cheatsheets

* Extract LaTeX from PDFs or handwritten notes in seconds with [mathpix](https://mathpix.com/)

* Use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) for collaborative latex coding

* put .tex files in `content` with 1 file/section, and images in `figures` . Keep `.pptx` if you use powerpoint to make your figures.
